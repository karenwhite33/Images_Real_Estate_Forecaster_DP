# **AIRBNB IMAGE FORECASTER**

## This project aims to create a Deep Learning model from 0 and using neural dense networks combining tabular and image data to predict real estate pricesüè´

Project and Arquitecture structure:

1. üíªData Preprocessing:

Downloaded and cleaned datasets, removing rows with missing images to maintain consistency between image and tabular data.
Applied normalization and resizing to both tabular and image datasets, ensuring consistent preprocessing pipelines.
Ensured that all preprocessing and transformations applied to the training data were reused for validation and test datasets to prevent data leakage.

2. ‚úÖModeling:

Designed and implemented a custom dense neural network for tabular data using features like Property Type, Room Type, and Bathrooms.
Developed and fine-tuned a model using pretrained architectures for image data, leveraging transfer learning and justifying the choice based on pretraining relevance.
Selected appropriate loss functions (e.g., regression or classification-specific) and optimized hyperparameters to improve model performance while preventing overfitting.

3. ‚ûïModel Fusion:

Experimented with early fusion techniques by combining features extracted from images with tabular data into a single input vector for predictions.
Explored late fusion approaches by generating separate predictions from tabular and image models, then integrating them using ensemble techniques (e.g., Random Forests or Neural Networks).

4. üëçIterative Baseline Improvement:

Established a baseline model for comparison, iteratively adding enhancements and evaluating their impact on the validation set.

5. ü™ÑPost-Processing and Predictions:

Applied post-processing steps to predictions, such as reverting normalized outputs to their original range for real-world interpretability.
Evaluated and refined predictions to ensure they met the objectives of regression or classification tasks.

7. üìàAdvanced Techniques:

Tackled missing values and engineered relevant features from the dataset to enhance model inputs.
Used scalable techniques like MinMaxScaler for regression and classification labeling strategies, optimizing input for the chosen model type.
